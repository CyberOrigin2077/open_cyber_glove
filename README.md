# OpenCyberGlove SDK

An open-source Python SDK for interfacing with data gloves, supporting real-time sensor data acquisition, calibration, and extensible inference. Designed for research, robotics, VR/AR, and HCI applications.

## Features
- Connect to one or two data gloves via serial port (1Mbps baudrate)
- Real-time sensor data acquisition at 120Hz
- Comprehensive sensor data including:
  - 19 tensile sensors
  - 3-axis accelerometer
  - 3-axis gyroscope
  - 3-axis magnetometer
  - Temperature sensor
  - Timestamp
- Automatic CRC validation for data integrity
- Interactive calibration with progress bars:
  - Min/max calibration for dynamic range
  - Static average calibration for baseline
- Real-time data visualization with matplotlib
- Threaded data acquisition with queue-based buffering
- Extensible inference interface for custom models

## Installation

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CyberOrigin2077/open_cyber_glove.git
cd open_cyber_glove
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For developers, you can install the package in editable mode, which helps in applying changes to the code without reinstalling.
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Dependencies
The package requires:
- Python 3.7+
- pyserial
- numpy
- matplotlib
- tqdm
- open3d

## Usage

Here are a few examples of how to use the `OpenCyberGlove` SDK.

### Basic Usage: Single Glove

This example shows how to connect to a single glove, calibrate it, and read raw sensor data.

```python
from open_cyber_glove.sdk import OpenCyberGlove

# Initialize SDK for a single left glove.
# Replace '/dev/ttyUSB0' with your glove's serial port.
sdk = OpenCyberGlove(left_port='/dev/ttyUSB0')

# Start the background data reader.
sdk.start()

# Calibrate the glove. This is an interactive process.
print("Starting calibration...")
sdk.calibrate()
print("Calibration finished.")

# Get the latest sensor data packet.
sensor_data = sdk.get_data('left')
print(f"Timestamp: {sensor_data.timestamp}")
print(f"Tensile data: {sensor_data.tensile_data}")
print(f"Accelerometer: {sensor_data.acc_data}")

# Stop the data reader.
sdk.stop()
```

### Hand Pose Inference

This example shows how to load a pre-trained model and perform inference to get hand joint angles.

```python
from open_cyber_glove.sdk import OpenCyberGlove

# Initialize SDK with port and path to the ONNX model.
sdk = OpenCyberGlove(left_port='/dev/ttyUSB0', model_path='model/20250616_164927_haichen_ensemble.onnx')

sdk.start()
sdk.calibrate()

# Get inferred joint angles.
joint_angles = sdk.get_angles('left', method='model')
print("Inferred joint angles (radians):", joint_angles)

sdk.stop()
```
**Note**: The quality of the inference heavily depends on the model and proper calibration.

### Dual Glove & Live Visualization

This example demonstrates managing two gloves simultaneously and visualizing their raw sensor data in real-time.

```python
from open_cyber_glove.sdk import OpenCyberGlove

# Initialize with ports for both left and right gloves.
# Replace with your actual serial ports.
sdk = OpenCyberGlove(left_port='/dev/ttyUSB0', right_port='/dev/ttyUSB1')

# Start data acquisition for both gloves.
sdk.start()

# Calibrate both gloves sequentially.
sdk.calibrate()

# Run real-time diagnosis with visualization.
# This will open a plot showing live sensor data.
# Close the plot window to stop.
sdk.diagnose()

# Stop all gloves.
sdk.stop()
```

## Calibration
The calibration process is interactive and consists of two phases:

1. **Min/Max Calibration**
   - Make a fist and open your hand repeatedly
   - Progress bar shows completion status
   - Captures dynamic range for each sensor

2. **Static Average Calibration**
   - Hold your hand static in a specific pose
   - Four fingers forward, thumb out 45Â°
   - Progress bar shows completion status
   - Calculates baseline values for each sensor

## Data Structure
The `GloveSensorData` class provides structured access to all sensor data:
- `tensile_data`: Tuple of 19 integers (0-16384)
- `acc_data`: Tuple of 3 floats (accelerometer)
- `gyro_data`: Tuple of 3 floats (gyroscope)
- `mag_data`: Tuple of 3 floats (magnetometer)
- `temperature`: Float
- `timestamp`: Integer
