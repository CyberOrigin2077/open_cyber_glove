## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup Guide

### Environment Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/open_cyber_glove.git
   cd open_cyber_glove
   ```

2. **Set up Poetry Environment**
   ```bash
   # Install poetry if you haven't (see https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
   # IMPORTANT: Poetry should be installed in its own isolated environment, NOT in your project's environment.

   # Install dependencies
   poetry install

   # Activate the virtual environment
   poetry shell
   ```

3. **Install Pre-commit Hooks**
   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit install
   ```

### Code Standards

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

1. **Ruff** for linting and formatting:
   - Line length: 160 characters
   - Python version: 3.10+
   - Auto-fixes available for many issues
   - Run: `poetry run ruff check .`

2. **MyPy** for type checking:
   - Strict optional checking
   - Run: `poetry run mypy .`

3. **Pre-commit Hooks** check:
   - Formatting (ruff-format)
   - Linting (ruff)
   - Type checking (mypy)
   - Run manually: `poetry run pre-commit run --all-files`

### PR Workflow

We follow the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) for all contributions. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `add-vision-model`, `fix-memory-leak`)
   - Create a separate branch for each set of unrelated changes

2. **Make Changes**
   - Write clear, documented code
   - Add tests for new features
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Commit and push changes regularly to backup your work
   - Each commit should contain an isolated, complete change

3. **Quality Checks**
   ```bash
   # Run all pre-commit hooks
   poetry run pre-commit run --all-files

   # Run tests
   poetry run pytest tests/
   ```
   - All CI checks must pass
   - Code must follow our style guidelines
   - Tests must pass

4. **Create Pull Request**
   - Write a clear PR description explaining the changes
   - Link related issues using keywords (e.g., "Fixes #123")
   - Include screenshots or examples if relevant
   - Mark as draft if you want early feedback
   - Request reviews from relevant team members

5. **Address Reviews**
   - Respond to all review comments
   - Make requested changes
   - Push additional commits as needed
   - Get required approvals

6. **Merge**
   - PR must have required approvals
   - All CI checks must pass
   - No merge conflicts
   - Squash commits if requested by reviewers

7. **Clean Up**
   - Delete your branch after merging
   - Close related issues if not auto-closed

  - Update README if needed
  - Add docstrings in NumPy format

- **Testing**
  - Write unit tests for new features
  - Ensure existing tests pass
  - Add integration tests if needed

- **PR Size**
  - Keep PRs focused on single changes
  - Split large changes into smaller PRs
  - Aim for reviewable chunks
