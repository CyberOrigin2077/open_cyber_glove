**Note:  This session contains important safety information regarding the use of OpenCyberGlove, both as a standalone device and when used to control external devices. Please read it carefully before use to ensure safe operation.**

### 1. Usage Safety

* Proper Wearing : Wear the glove snugly but comfortably. Too tight may affect blood circulation; too loose may cause inaccurate data collection.
* Handling & Storage : The glove contains sensitive flexible sensors and electronics. Handle with care. Avoid pulling, folding, or pressing cables or the glove itself. Store in a dry, shaded, room-temperature environment.
* Electrical Safety : The glove is powered via USB. Connect only to stable, certified USB ports (e.g., computers or certified hubs). Do not use in wet environments. Keep liquids away from the glove and all electronic components.
* Cleaning & Hygiene : For cleaning, gently wipe the surface with a dry or slightly damp cloth. Do not wash or use chemical solvents. For hygiene, we recommend personal use only, or use sanitation measures for shared use.

### 2. Operation & Connection Safety

* Connection Check : Before each use, ensure the USB cable is securely connected to both the glove and computer.
* Getting Started : First-time users are advised to test the glove using the provided software visualization tools to understand data output and mapping.
* Initial Calibration : Before starting any control program, place your hand in a natural, relaxed position and complete calibration according to SDK instructions to ensure accuracy.
* Smooth Operation : Move your hand smoothly during use. Sudden or forceful movements may lead to unexpected responses from controlled virtual or physical systems.
* Fault Handling : If you encounter issues like signal loss, data jumps, or high latency, stop immediately. Check hardware connections and software status. Do not continue until the issue is resolved.

### 3. System Integration & Environmental Safety

* No Haptic Feedback : This glove is an input-only device. It does not provide haptic feedback or collision protection.
* Application Responsibility : When controlling robots or mechanical arms, it is your responsibility to implement safety features such as collision detection, limit switches, and emergency stops within the controlled system.
* Emergency Plan : When operating physical equipment, have a safety officer present and ensure immediate access to the emergency stop button.
* Open Source Risks : As an open-source product, users may modify hardware/software at their own risk. We assume no liability for damage caused by unauthorized modifications or integrations.

### 4. Disclaimer

* These guidelines are general. Users must ensure compliance with local laws and industry standards.
* CYBERORIGIN PTE. LTD. assumes no liability for direct or indirect damages resulting from misuse, unauthorized modification, or improper application.
* This product must not be used in any high-risk or life-critical applications. Any consequences arising from such use are solely the user's responsibility.

## Proper Use Guidelines

### 1. Usage Requirements

* **Gentle Handling**: The glove contains delicate sensors and electronics. Avoid impacts, pressure, stretching, or twisting. Keep sharp objects away and avoid crushing the glove.
* **Avoid Pulling** : When adjusting or removing the glove, hold the wrist or palm area. Never pull on the flexible PCB or circuit box, as this can damage internal connections.
* **Correct Connection** : Always use the included or certified USB cable. Connect to a stable USB port to prevent power-related damage.
* **Protect from Damage**: During use, avoid applying strong forces that could harm the internal sensors.
* **Modification Notice**: This is open-source hardware. While modifications are allowed, unofficial changes (e.g., adding components or altering circuits) may reduce performance and lifespan. Users bear full risk.

### 2. Daily Maintenance

* **Pre/Post-Use Inspection** : Check the glove body for wear or broken threads. Inspect the USB cable and connectors for damage. Stop use if abnormalities are found.
* **Storage** :\
  After use, store the glove flat in its case or on a clean surface.
  Do not crumple or bend sharply at connection points. Avoid heavy objects pressing on the glove.
  Environmental Conditions : Avoid prolonged exposure to heat, moisture, dust, or strong magnetic fields. These can affect sensor accuracy and component lifespan.
* **Cleaning** :\
  Clean with a soft dry or damp cloth.
  Do not immerse in water or use alcohol/solvent-based cleaners, which may cause short circuits or material damage.
